Starting this project was the most dificult part. Getting to know the gridworld and what i can do.
My algorithm used arraylists and I had to experiment with those a little. The unit test was the other difficult
part. I really do not think I did that right. As for advice on for next years students, the most important thing
is to be able to keep track of all of your living cells locations and updateing the grid.
I used a Array list. After that there are multiple algorithms that can be used to figure out where to put the 
actactors. Overall i really liked this project and i was really happy when i finally found an algorthm that works.
